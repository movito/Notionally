**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Branch:** `feature/v2.0.0-notion-api-prep`
**Tester:** Claude Code
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Test 2.1: Version Inventory Check

**Status:** ‚úÖ EXECUTED
**Result:** ‚ùå FAILED (Issues Identified)

### Test Execution

```bash
cd local-app
npm run check-versions
```

### Results

**Package.json Version:** `1.8.0` ‚úÖ

**Greasemonkey Script Situation:**

Found MULTIPLE greasemonkey script versions in the repository:
```
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.7.5.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v2.0.0.user.js    ‚Üê v2.0.0 EXISTS!
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.9.0.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.9.2.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.9.3.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.9.4.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.9.5.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.10.0.user.js   ‚Üê Check script found this
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.11.0.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.12.0.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.13.0.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.14.0.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.15.0.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.15.1.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.16.0.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.16.1.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.16.2.user.js   ‚Üê HIGHEST version
```

**Debug/Variant Scripts:**
```
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.9.1-debug.user.js
linkedin-notion-saver-v1.11.1-pulse-debug.user.js
```

### Issues Identified

1. **‚ùå Multiple Production Scripts**
   - 17 different versioned scripts exist
   - Violates "One version, one script" principle
   - Unclear which is the actual production script

2. **‚ùå Version Check Script Confusion**
   - Check script found v1.10.0 (probably first alphabetically)
   - But v2.0.0 EXISTS in the repo
   - Latest appears to be v1.16.2

3. **‚ùå Violates Versioning Standards**
   - Per VERSIONING_STANDARDS.md: "ONE production script at any given version number"
   - Should have old versions in archive/ directory

### Critical Questions ANSWERED

1. **What is main branch actually at?**
   - ‚úÖ Main branch: v1.7.5 (per package.json and CHANGELOG)
   - ‚úÖ All 17 greasemonkey scripts exist on main branch too
   - ‚úÖ This is the CURRENT production version

2. **Why do all these versions exist?**
   - ‚úÖ Git history shows previous development:
     - `feature/v2.0.0-pulse-articles-support` (merged)
     - `feature/v1.9.0-pulse-articles` (merged)
     - Various v1.8.1, v1.10+ versions developed
   - ‚úÖ Then rolled back to v1.7.5 on main
   - ‚úÖ Scripts from those branches were never cleaned up!

3. **Is v2.0.0 script correct?**
   - ‚ùå The existing v2.0.0 script is from PULSE ARTICLES feature
   - ‚ùå It has NOTHING to do with our Notion API upgrade
   - ‚ùå We are trying to create a NEW v2.0.0 for a DIFFERENT purpose
   - ‚ùå VERSION NUMBER COLLISION!

### üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY

**VERSION NUMBER COLLISION DETECTED!**

The version number **v2.0.0** has ALREADY been used for a different feature (Pulse Articles support) that was later rolled back.

**Git History:**
- v1.7.5 - Current main (Jan 2025)
- v2.0.0 - Pulse articles support (developed, then rolled back)
- v1.9.0 - More pulse articles work (merged, then rolled back)
- v1.8.1, v1.10-v1.16.2 - Various attempts/features (rolled back)

**Our Mistake:**
- We chose v2.0.0 for Notion API upgrade
- But v2.0.0 already exists in history for a DIFFERENT purpose
- This creates confusion and violates semantic versioning

### Action Items

- [x] ‚úÖ Identified main branch is v1.7.5
- [x] ‚úÖ Discovered version history complexity
- [x] ‚úÖ Found version number collision
- [ ] ‚ùå **STOP: Need to choose correct version number**
- [ ] ‚ùå **DECISION REQUIRED: What version should we use?**

### Recommended Path Forward

**Option 1: Use v1.17.0** (Safest)
- Skip past all the rolled-back versions
- Clean slate, no confusion
- Clearly newer than anything in repo

**Option 2: Use v1.9.0** (Reuse)
- If v1.9.0 was rolled back completely
- Check if it conflicts

**Option 3: Use v2.0.0** (Semantic)
- SDK upgrade could be considered breaking
- Jump to v2.0.0 now, skip v2.0.0 prep phase
- Cleaner version story

**Recommendation:** Use **v1.17.0** or **v2.0.0**

### Next Steps

üõë **TESTING PAUSED**

**Reason:** Must resolve version number collision before proceeding

**Required Decision:**
- Choose correct version number for Notion API upgrade
- Understand full version history
- Clean up repository of rolled-back versions

## Test 2.2: Module Loading

**Status:** PENDING

Waiting to complete version inventory analysis before proceeding.

## Test 2.3: SDK Version Verification

**Status:** PENDING

## Summary

**Phase 2 Status:** BLOCKED

**Blocker:** Need to understand greasemonkey script versioning situation before proceeding.

**Critical Finding:** The repository has accumulated many versioned scripts over time, creating confusion about which is current/production.

**Recommendation:**
1. Check main branch to establish baseline
2. Understand versioning history
3. Clean up before proceeding with v2.0.0
4. May need to reconsider v2.0.0 version number if higher versions exist

**Test Log Timestamp:** 2025-09-30
**Next Action:** Investigate greasemonkey versioning on main branch
