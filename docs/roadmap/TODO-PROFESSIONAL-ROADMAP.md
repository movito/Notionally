## 📊 Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working
- Core functionality (LinkedIn → Notion saving)
- URL unfurling for shortened links
- Video/image processing
- Modular architecture with service layer
- Debug information tracking

### ❌ Critical Gaps
- **Security:** Exposed credentials, no authentication, no rate limiting
- **Testing:** 0% test coverage
- **Monitoring:** No logging, metrics, or error tracking
- **Documentation:** Missing API docs, deployment guides
- **Operations:** No CI/CD, containerization, or backup strategy
- **Compliance:** No GDPR considerations, data retention policies
