# Security Documentation

Security audits, plans, and current protection measures for notionally.

## Documents

### Security Assessments
- [SECURITY-AUDIT-CRITICAL.md](./SECURITY-AUDIT-CRITICAL.md) - Comprehensive security audit
  - Vulnerability assessment
  - Risk levels
  - Mitigation strategies

### Implementation Plans
- [SECURITY_UPGRADE_PLAN.md](./SECURITY_UPGRADE_PLAN.md) - Phased security improvements
  - Phase 1: Low-risk changes (completed)
  - Phase 2: Input validation (completed)
  - Phase 3: Rate limiting (in progress)
  - Phase 4: CORS refinement (planned)

### Current State
- [PROTECTION_SUMMARY.md](./PROTECTION_SUMMARY.md) - Active security measures
  - What's protected
  - How it's protected
  - Known limitations

## üîí Security Status

### Implemented (v1.0.4)
‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization
‚úÖ Security headers (safe subset)
‚úÖ Error message sanitization
‚úÖ XSS prevention
‚úÖ Size limits
‚úÖ Environment validation

### In Progress (v1.0.5)
üîÑ Rate limiting (30 req/min)

### Planned
üìã CORS refinement (high risk)
üìã Additional monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Principles

1. **Functionality First** - Security must not break core features
2. **Incremental Approach** - Small, tested changes
3. **Local Context** - This is a local tool, not a public API
4. **Appropriate Security** - Match security to actual risk

## Known Limitations

From [PROTECTION_SUMMARY.md](./PROTECTION_SUMMARY.md):
- Local-only deployment (not internet-facing)
- CORS must allow LinkedIn domains
- No CSP (interferes with LinkedIn)
- Rate limiting with localhost bypass

## Testing Security Changes

### Security Test Suite
```bash
cd local-app
./scripts/test-security.sh
```
Expected: 11/12 passing (CSP test expected to fail)

### Critical Functionality Test
```bash
./scripts/test-critical.sh
```
Must maintain 7/7 passing

## Security Implementation History

1. **v1.0.2** - Phase 1 security (logging, env validation)
2. **v1.0.3** - Duplicate prevention (cache security)
3. **v1.0.4** - Security hardening (headers, sanitization)
4. **v1.0.5** - Rate limiting (in progress)

## For Security Reviewers

When reviewing security:
1. Read [SECURITY_UPGRADE_PLAN.md](./SECURITY_UPGRADE_PLAN.md)
2. Check [PROTECTION_SUMMARY.md](./PROTECTION_SUMMARY.md)
3. Test with `test-security.sh`
4. Verify LinkedIn still works
