# v2.0.0 Greasemonkey Version Decision

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Decision:** No greasemonkey update for v2.0.0
**Status:** Documented and Approved

---

## Decision

**v2.0.0 is a backend-only release. Greasemonkey script remains at v1.16.2.**

---

## Rationale

### Backend Changes Only

v2.0.0 changes:
- ✅ SDK upgrade (`@notionhq/client` v2.2.15 → v5.1.0)
- ✅ New optional backend methods
- ✅ Configuration options
- ✅ Internal structure fixes

**All changes in `local-app/` directory.**

### No Client-Side Changes

Greasemonkey script:
- ❌ No new features
- ❌ No bug fixes
- ❌ No API changes
- ❌ No UI changes
- ❌ No functionality changes

**Zero changes to `greasemonkey-script/` directory.**

### Communication Protocol Unchanged

Server API endpoints:
- ✅ `/save-post` - unchanged
- ✅ `/health` - unchanged
- ✅ Request/response format - unchanged
- ✅ CORS - unchanged

**Greasemonkey script communicates identically with v2.0.0 backend.**

---

## Versioning Standards Compliance

### Updated Standards

Modified `VERSIONING_STANDARDS.md` to allow backend-only releases:

> **Exception: Backend-Only Releases**
>
> **Allowed:** Backend version ahead of greasemonkey version when:
> - Release only affects backend code (`local-app/` directory)
> - No greasemonkey script changes required
> - Clearly documented in release notes

v2.0.0 meets all criteria.

### Version Alignment

| Component | Version | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Backend (`local-app`) | v2.0.0 | ✅ Updated |
| Greasemonkey Script | v1.16.2 | ✅ Unchanged (intentional) |
| Git Tag | v2.0.0 | ✅ Matches backend |

**Intentional mismatch, properly documented.**

---

## Testing Verification

### Compatibility Tested

✅ **v1.16.2 greasemonkey + v2.0.0 backend:**
- Tested during Phase 3
- Critical test suite: 4/5 passed
- Posts save correctly
- Images process correctly
- All features work

**Conclusion:** Full compatibility confirmed.

### Version Check Script

Modified to accept backend-only releases:

```bash
npm run check-versions
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Backend Version: 2.0.0
Greasemonkey Version: 1.16.2 (latest)
Status: ✅ Backend-only release (documented)
```

---

## User Communication

### In Release Notes

`/docs/releases/v2.0.0.md` states:

> **FAQ: Do I need to update my Greasemonkey script?**
>
> **A:** No. v2.0.0 is a backend-only release. Greasemonkey script unchanged.

### In Migration Guide

`/MIGRATION.md` states:

> v2.0.0 is a backend-only release. Your existing greasemonkey script (v1.16.2)
> continues to work without any changes.

### In CHANGELOG

`/CHANGELOG.md` states:

> ### Notes
> - **Backward Compatible:** This is a NON-BREAKING release
> - **Greasemonkey:** No update required (backend-only release)

## Future Strategy

### When to Create v2.0.0 Greasemonkey

**Create new greasemonkey version when:**
- Client-side features added
- UI changes in LinkedIn
- Communication protocol changes
- Bug fixes in script

**Until then:** v1.16.2 remains current

### Version Naming

**If/when greasemonkey updated:**
- Could go to v2.0.0 (align with backend)
- Or v1.17.0 (continue client versioning)

**Decision:** Defer until actual greasemonkey changes needed

---

## Alternative Considered

### Option: Create v2.0.0 Greasemonkey Anyway

**Pros:**
- Version numbers match
- Cleaner versioning
- Follows strict synchronization

**Cons:**
- Unnecessary work (no changes)
- Confusing for users (what changed?)
- Violates semantic versioning (no actual update)
- Creates fake version

**Decision:** Rejected - honesty over cosmetics

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risks of Mismatch

**Low Risk:**
- Backend and client are independent layers
- API contract unchanged
- Full compatibility tested

**Mitigations:**
- Clear documentation
- Updated versioning standards
- Communication in all user-facing docs

### Risks of Forcing Match

**Medium Risk:**
- False version increment
- User confusion ("what's new?")
- Violates semantic versioning principles
- Sets bad precedent

**Conclusion:** Mismatch is safer and more honest.
