# Incremental Security Strategy for notionally

## Our Approach: Baby Steps with Testing

### Why This Strategy?
We previously tried adding comprehensive security (Helmet, rate limiting, validation) all at once, which broke LinkedIn integration. This time we're taking a different approach:

1. **One Change at a Time**: Add single security feature, test, commit
2. **Test with Real LinkedIn**: Not just curl, but actual Greasemonkey script
3. **Rollback Immediately**: If it breaks, revert instantly
4. **Document Everything**: Track what works and what doesn't

### The Four Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Safe) ✅
- Request logging
- Error handling  
- Environment validation
**Risk**: Very Low - These don't affect request/response flow

#### Phase 2: Input Validation (Careful) ⚠️
- Content-Type checking
- Required fields validation
- Size limits per field
**Risk**: Medium - Could reject valid LinkedIn requests

#### Phase 3: Rate Limiting (Test Heavily) ⚠️
- Start with generous limits (30/min)
- Gradually tighten based on usage
**Risk**: High - Could block legitimate rapid saves

#### Phase 4: CORS Refinement (Danger Zone) 🚨
- Specific origin allowlist
- Credential handling
**Risk**: Very High - Most likely to break LinkedIn

### Testing Protocol

Each change MUST pass this checklist:
- [ ] Server starts successfully
- [ ] Health endpoint responds
- [ ] Test endpoint accepts LinkedIn origin
- [ ] Save-post accepts LinkedIn origin
- [ ] Greasemonkey script connects
- [ ] Real LinkedIn post saves
- [ ] No errors in browser console
- [ ] No errors in server logs

### What We Learned from v2.0.0 Failure

**What Broke**:
- Helmet's security headers blocked CORS
- Rate limiting was too aggressive
- Validation rejected valid LinkedIn data

**What We'll Do Differently**:
1. No Helmet (use individual headers if needed)
2. Start with very loose limits
3. Test with real LinkedIn data structure
4. Keep CORS permissive for local dev

### Agent Responsibilities

**security-reviewer**: Identify vulnerabilities but DON'T suggest Helmet or strict CORS
**feature-developer**: Implement changes ONE AT A TIME with testing
**test-runner**: Test with real LinkedIn, not just curl
**code-reviewer**: Ensure changes are minimal and focused

### Success Metrics

A security upgrade is successful when:
- ✅ LinkedIn still works perfectly
- ✅ Security improvement is measurable
- ✅ No user-facing errors
- ✅ Clear rollback path exists
- ✅ Change is documented

### Current Status

- **Branch**: `feature/v1.0.1-careful-upgrades`
- **Base**: Stable v1.0.0 (proven working)
- **Next Task**: TASK-004 (Phase 1 Security)
- **Agent Ready**: feature-developer can start

### Command Reference

```bash
# Launch feature-developer for Phase 1
./agents/launch-feature-developer.sh

# Test LinkedIn integration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/save-post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: https://www.linkedin.com" \
  -d '{"text":"Test","author":"User","url":"https://linkedin.com/test"}'

# Quick rollback if needed
git reset --hard HEAD
npm restart
```

### Remember

> "Perfect security that doesn't work is worse than good-enough security that does."

We're building a LOCAL tool for personal use, not a production API. Our security should be appropriate for that context.
