# Merge Resolution Strategy

## Current Situation

The `feature/v1.0.1-careful-upgrades` branch fixes issues introduced in master but has merge conflicts.

## Conflict Source

**Master branch has:**
- Security middleware that breaks LinkedIn (Helmet headers)
- Rate limiting that may be too restrictive
- Validation that might be too strict

**Our branch has:**
- Working CORS without Helmet
- No rate limiting (yet)
- Basic validation only
- All functionality restored and tested

## Resolution Strategy

### Option 1: Force Merge (Recommended)
Our branch is the correct version. Master is broken.

```bash
# On feature branch
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/v1.0.1-careful-upgrades

# Then merge via GitHub PR with "Create merge commit"
# This preserves our working version
```

### Option 2: Manual Conflict Resolution
```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout feature/v1.0.1-careful-upgrades
git merge master

# For each conflict:
# - Keep our version of server.js (no security middleware)
# - Keep our version of package.json (if conflicts)
# - Accept master's version of files we haven't touched

git add .
git commit -m "Merge master, keeping working functionality"
git push
```

### Option 3: Replace Master
Since master is broken and our branch works:

```bash
git checkout master
git reset --hard feature/v1.0.1-careful-upgrades
git push --force origin master
```

## Why Our Version is Correct

1. **It works** - All features functional, tests pass
2. **It's tested** - Automated test suite verifies functionality
3. **It's documented** - Clear record of what was fixed and why
4. **Master is broken** - v2.0.0 "optimizations" broke core features

## Files to Keep From Our Branch

Critical files that MUST use our version:
- `local-app/src/server.js` - No security middleware
- `local-app/src/dropbox-handler.js` - API upload logic
- `local-app/src/notion-client.js` - Image handling
- `local-app/src/services/PostProcessingService.js` - Working flow

## Testing After Merge

```bash
npm start
./local-app/scripts/test-critical.sh
# All tests must pass
```

## The Key Point

**Master is broken. Our branch works.**

The merge conflict exists because master has "improvements" that actually break the app. Our branch removes those "improvements" and restores functionality.

The correct resolution is to use our version entirely.
