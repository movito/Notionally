# Test Suites Overview for v1.1.0

## Available Test Suites

### 1. Master Test Runner
**Command**: `./scripts/test-all.sh`
**Purpose**: Run all tests and generate comprehensive report
**Use When**: Validating release candidates or major merges

### 2. Individual Test Suites

| Test Suite | Script | Pass Criteria | Priority |
|------------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical Functionality** | `test-critical.sh` | 7/7 MUST pass | CRITICAL |
| **Interactive Setup** | `test-interactive-setup.sh` | 10/10 MUST pass | CRITICAL |
| **Duplicate Prevention** | `test-duplicate-prevention.sh` | 5/5 should pass | HIGH |
| **Rate Limiting** | `test-rate-limiting.sh` | 6/8 expected* | MEDIUM |
| **Security** | `test-security.sh` | 11/12 expected* | HIGH |
| **Documentation** | `test-doc-references.sh` | 15/15 should pass | MEDIUM |

*Known issues documented in TEST-RUNNER-GUIDE.md

## New in v1.1.0

### Interactive Setup Tests
Tests the new CLI setup wizard feature:
- File structure validation
- NPM scripts configuration  
- Config detection logic
- Dependencies verification
- Module exports
- Error handling
- First run detection
- Skip setup flags

**Run with**: `./scripts/test-interactive-setup.sh`

### Comprehensive Test Runner
New master test suite that:
- Runs all tests in sequence
- Generates detailed report
- Provides merge recommendations
- Tracks test runtime
- Shows known issues

**Run with**: `./scripts/test-all.sh`

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run everything
cd local-app
./scripts/test-all.sh

# Run only critical tests
./scripts/test-critical.sh

# Test new setup feature
./scripts/test-interactive-setup.sh

# Test specific feature
./scripts/test-rate-limiting.sh
./scripts/test-security.sh
./scripts/test-duplicate-prevention.sh
```

## Test Results Interpretation

### For test-all.sh Output

**✅ APPROVED FOR MERGE**
- All critical tests passed
- Non-critical failures within acceptable range
- Safe to merge to main

**⚠️ CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**
- Critical tests passed
- Multiple non-critical failures
- Review failures before merging

**❌ BLOCKED - DO NOT MERGE**
- Critical tests failed
- Build is not stable
- Must fix before proceeding

## Testing Workflow for v1.1.0

1. **Before Testing**
   ```bash
   cd local-app
   npm install  # Ensure dependencies are current
   ```

2. **Run Full Test Suite**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-all.sh
   ```

3. **If Failures Occur**
   - Check if failures are known issues
   - Run individual failing test for details
   - Consult TEST-RUNNER-GUIDE.md for workarounds

4. **Generate Report**
   The test-all.sh script automatically generates a summary with:
   - Pass/fail counts
   - Runtime metrics
   - Recommendations
   - Known issues noted

## Interactive Setup Testing

Since v1.1.0 adds interactive setup, test it specifically:

### Manual Test Flow
1. Backup existing config: `mv config.json config.json.backup`
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Verify setup wizard launches
4. Test with invalid credentials (should fail gracefully)
5. Restore config: `mv config.json.backup config.json`

### Automated Test
```bash
./scripts/test-interactive-setup.sh
```

This runs 10 test groups covering all setup functionality.

## Known Issues

From TEST-RUNNER-GUIDE.md:

1. **Rate Limiting Headers Test**
   - Shows as failed but is false positive
   - Actual functionality works correctly

2. **Security Moderate Size Test**  
   - Pre-existing issue
   - Does not affect normal operation

## For Test-Runner Agents

When running tests for v1.1.0:

1. Always start with `test-all.sh`
2. Focus on CRITICAL tests first
3. Document any new failures not in known issues
4. Use the recommendation from test-all.sh in your report
5. Include test runtime in performance notes

## Success Metrics

v1.1.0 is ready for release when:
- ✅ Critical tests: 7/7 passing
- ✅ Interactive setup tests: 10/10 passing  
- ✅ Documentation tests: No broken references
- ⚠️ Rate limiting: 6/8 (known issues)
- ⚠️ Security: 11/12 (known issue)
- ✅ No performance degradation
