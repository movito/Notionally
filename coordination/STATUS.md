## 🔒 Security Phases Status

| Phase | Description | Status | Risk Level |
|-------|------------|--------|------------|
| Phase 1 | Logging, Error Handling, Env Validation | ✅ Complete (v1.0.1) | Low |
| Phase 2 | Input Validation | ✅ Complete (v1.0.2) | Medium |
| Phase 3 | Security Hardening | ✅ Complete (v1.0.4) | Medium |
| Phase 4 | Rate Limiting | ✅ Complete (v1.0.5) | High |
| Phase 5 | CORS Refinement | ⏳ Future | Very High |

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. ✅ Test-runner to verify TASK-008 implementation
2. Merge v1.0.5 to master after verification
3. Monitor rate limiting effectiveness in production
4. Consider next features or improvements

## ⚠️ Remember
- Test after EVERY change
- Keep changes small and incremental
- Always have a rollback plan
- Never sacrifice stability for features
