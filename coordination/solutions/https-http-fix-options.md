# Options to Fix HTTPS->HTTP Connection Issue

## Current Situation
- Greasemonkey script v1.6.0 works perfectly with `@grant none`
- LinkedIn (HTTPS) blocks connections to localhost:8765 (HTTP)
- Adding GM_xmlhttpRequest breaks the entire script context

## Option 1: HTTPS Local Server (RECOMMENDED)
Set up the local server with self-signed HTTPS certificate.

**Pros:**
- No script changes needed
- Works with existing v1.6.0 script
- Most reliable solution

**Cons:**
- Need to accept self-signed certificate in browser
- One-time setup complexity

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// server.js
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('localhost-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('localhost.pem')
};

https.createServer(options, app).listen(8765);
```

## Option 2: Browser Extension Instead of Greasemonkey
Create a proper Firefox/Chrome extension with background script.

**Pros:**
- Full control over permissions
- Can handle mixed content properly
- Better long-term solution

**Cons:**
- More complex to develop
- Requires extension installation/management

## Option 3: Proxy Through Public HTTPS Service
Use a service like ngrok to tunnel localhost.

**Pros:**
- Quick setup
- Real HTTPS URL

**Cons:**
- Requires external service
- May have latency
- Privacy concerns

## Option 4: Disable Mixed Content Protection (NOT RECOMMENDED)
User manually disables mixed content protection in Firefox.

**Pros:**
- Works immediately
- No code changes

**Cons:**
- Security risk
- Per-site setting
- Not user-friendly

## Option 5: WebSocket Connection
Use WSS (WebSocket Secure) for communication.

**Pros:**
- Can work around mixed content in some cases
- Real-time communication

**Cons:**
- Major refactoring needed
- Still may hit mixed content issues

## Recommendation: Option 1 - HTTPS Local Server

This is the cleanest solution that:
1. Keeps the working Greasemonkey script unchanged
2. Maintains security
3. Is a one-time setup
4. Works reliably across browsers

Steps:
1. Generate self-signed certificate for localhost
2. Configure Express to use HTTPS
3. Update CONFIG.localServerUrl to https://localhost:8765
4. Accept certificate in browser (one-time)
