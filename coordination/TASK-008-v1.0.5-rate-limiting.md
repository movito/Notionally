# TASK-008: Rate Limiting Implementation (v1.0.5)

## Status: PENDING

## Overview
Implement rate limiting to protect the server from potential abuse while ensuring legitimate usage is never blocked. This is a HIGH RISK feature that requires careful implementation and extensive testing.

## Context
- Current state: No rate limiting (unlimited requests)
- Target: Protective rate limiting without impacting normal usage
- Risk: Could block legitimate rapid saves if too restrictive

## Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Implement rate limiting on /save-post endpoint
2. Start with very generous limits (30 requests per minute)
3. Ensure localhost bypass (never rate limit local requests)
4. Add monitoring to track actual usage patterns
5. Provide clear error messages when limits are hit

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Rate Limiting Strategy
- Use `express-rate-limit` middleware
- Window: 1 minute sliding window
- Initial limit: 30 requests per minute per IP
- Headers: Include rate limit info in response headers

#### 2. Bypass Rules
- Always bypass for localhost/127.0.0.1
- Consider bypass for ::1 (IPv6 localhost)
- No rate limiting on health check endpoints

#### 3. Error Handling
- Return 429 (Too Many Requests) when limit exceeded
- Include retry-after header
- Provide user-friendly error message
- Log rate limit hits for monitoring

#### 4. Configuration
- Make limits configurable via config.json
- Default to permissive if not configured
- Allow environment variable override

### Technical Specifications

```javascript
// config.json addition
{
  "rateLimiting": {
    "enabled": true,
    "windowMs": 60000,  // 1 minute
    "maxRequests": 30,   // 30 requests per window
    "skipLocalhost": true,
    "message": "Too many requests, please slow down"
  }
}
```

```javascript
// Rate limiter setup
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: config.rateLimiting.windowMs || 60000,
  max: config.rateLimiting.maxRequests || 30,
  skip: (req) => {
    // Skip localhost
    const ip = req.ip || req.connection.remoteAddress;
    return ip === '127.0.0.1' || ip === '::1' || ip === 'localhost';
  },
  message: config.rateLimiting.message,
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false
});

// Apply only to /save-post
app.use('/save-post', limiter);
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
1. Test rate limit triggers after X requests
2. Test localhost bypass works
3. Test rate limit reset after window
4. Test headers are included in response

### Integration Tests
1. Rapid sequential saves (simulate real usage)
2. Concurrent saves from same IP
3. Multiple IPs simultaneously
4. Verify no impact on other endpoints

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Normal single save works
- [ ] Can save 5 posts rapidly without issues
- [ ] Rate limit kicks in at 31st request
- [ ] Clear error message displayed
- [ ] Retry-after header present
- [ ] Localhost never limited
- [ ] Health endpoint not affected
- [ ] Test endpoints not affected

## Success Criteria
1. Rate limiting active and working
2. No legitimate usage blocked
3. All existing tests still pass
4. Performance not degraded
5. Clear feedback when limits hit

## Rollback Plan
1. Remove rate limiting middleware
2. Remove config entries
3. Revert to previous version
4. Document why it failed

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with very high limits (30/min)
- Monitor for false positives
- Easy disable via config
- Comprehensive bypass rules
- Gradual rollout approach

## Implementation Steps
1. Install express-rate-limit package
2. Add configuration to config.json
3. Implement rate limiter with bypass
4. Add to /save-post route only
5. Test with various scenarios
6. Add monitoring/logging
7. Document usage patterns observed

## Dependencies
- express-rate-limit npm package
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Backward compatible configuration

## Notes
- This is a protective measure, not a restriction
- Better to be too permissive than too restrictive
- Can tighten limits later based on observed patterns
- Consider implementing per-user limits in future

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Localhost bypass working
- [ ] Configuration flexible
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Clear error messages
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Documentation updated
