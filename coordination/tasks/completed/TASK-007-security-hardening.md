# TASK-007: Security Hardening - Safe Improvements

## Status
- **Assigned To**: feature-developer
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-09-02
- **Updated**: 2025-09-02
- **Completed**: 2025-09-02
- **Risk**: LOW
- **Branch**: feature/v1.0.4-security-fixes-1
- **Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## Description
Implement additional security hardening measures that are safe and won't break LinkedIn integration.

## Objectives
Add security improvements that enhance protection without affecting functionality.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Add Request ID to Error Responses ✅
Completed - Request IDs present in all error responses

### 2. Sanitize Error Messages ✅
Completed - Added comprehensive error sanitization:
- File paths replaced with [path] placeholder
- API keys and secrets masked
- Stack traces hidden from client
- Full details retained in server logs

### 3. Add Security Headers (Safe Ones Only) ✅
Completed - All safe headers added:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Headers applied to all endpoints via middleware

### 4. Input Sanitization ✅
Completed - Comprehensive XSS prevention:
- Created sanitization.js utility module
- HTML tags and scripts removed from text
- Special characters escaped
- Dangerous URL protocols blocked (javascript:, data:, etc.)
- All input sanitized before processing

### 5. Environment Variable Security ✅
Completed - Multiple security measures:
- .env file permission check on startup
- Warning for overly permissive file modes
- API keys masked in console output
- Secrets removed from error messages

### 6. Request Body Size Limit ✅
Completed - Optimized per-endpoint limits:
- /save-post: 25MB (reduced from 50MB)
- /test-save: 10MB
- /health, /test-error: 1KB
- Default: 100KB
- More appropriate and secure limits

## Testing Requirements

After EACH change:
1. Run `./local-app/scripts/test-critical.sh`
2. Test with real LinkedIn post
3. Verify LinkedIn integration still works
4. Check server logs for any errors
5. Test with posts containing:
   - Special characters
   - Long text
   - Multiple images
   - Videos

## Safety Checklist
- [ ] NO changes to CORS configuration
- [ ] NO Helmet middleware
- [ ] NO strict CSP headers
- [ ] NO changes that could block LinkedIn
- [ ] All changes are additive only
- [ ] Easy to revert if issues arise

## Implementation Order
1. Start with error message sanitization (safest)
2. Add safe security headers one at a time
3. Test after each header addition
4. Implement input sanitization
5. Final comprehensive testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All existing tests pass (7/7 critical tests)
- [x] No new errors in server logs
- [x] LinkedIn posts still save correctly
- [x] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [x] Security headers present in responses (verified)
- [x] No performance impact (minimal overhead <1ms)

## Rollback Plan
If ANY issue occurs:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 src/server.js
npm start
./local-app/scripts/test-critical.sh
```

## Notes
- These are all LOW RISK improvements
- Focus on defense in depth
- Don't over-engineer
- If in doubt, skip it
- Remember: Working > Secure but broken
