# Notionally Development Roadmap

## Current State: v1.0.1 (Protected & Stable)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Core LinkedIn to Notion pipeline
- [x] Image processing and Dropbox embedding
- [x] Video processing
- [x] Phase 1 security (logging, error handling, env validation)
- [x] Automated testing suite
- [x] Pre-commit protection hooks
- [x] Comprehensive documentation

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] Phase 2 security improvements (careful validation)

### üìã Planned Phases

## Phase 2: Input Validation (Q1 2025)
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Testing Required**: Extensive

- [ ] Content-Type validation on /save-post
- [ ] Required fields validation
- [ ] Size limits per field
- [ ] Test with various LinkedIn post types
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Phase 3: Rate Limiting (Q2 2025)
**Risk Level**: High
**Testing Required**: Extensive with real usage patterns

- [ ] Start with generous limits (30 req/min)
- [ ] Monitor actual usage patterns
- [ ] Gradually tighten limits
- [ ] Ensure doesn't block legitimate rapid saves
- [ ] Implement bypass for localhost

## Phase 4: CORS Refinement (Q3 2025)
**Risk Level**: Very High
**Testing Required**: Exhaustive LinkedIn testing

- [ ] Document all LinkedIn domains/subdomains
- [ ] Test with various LinkedIn URLs
- [ ] Implement fallback to permissive CORS
- [ ] Emergency override mechanism
- [ ] Extensive production testing

## Future Enhancements (No Timeline)

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Image processing optimization
- [ ] Video compression settings
- [ ] Parallel processing improvements
- [ ] Caching strategy

### Feature Additions
- [ ] Batch post processing
- [ ] LinkedIn article support
- [ ] Document attachment handling
- [ ] Post scheduling
- [ ] Bulk export functionality

### User Experience
- [ ] Progress indicators in Greasemonkey
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] Retry mechanism visibility
- [ ] Success notifications
- [ ] Configuration UI

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Improved logging system
- [ ] Debug mode
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Integration tests

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Not Doing)

These have been considered and rejected:

‚ùå **Architecture rewrite** - Current architecture works
‚ùå **Microservices split** - Adds complexity without benefit
‚ùå **Database addition** - Notion is the database
‚ùå **User authentication** - Local tool, not needed
‚ùå **Cloud deployment** - Must remain local for Dropbox

## Success Metrics

Each phase must meet these criteria:
1. All existing tests still pass
2. No performance degradation
3. LinkedIn integration unaffected
4. Image embedding still works
5. No increase in error rate

## Release Process

1. **Development**
   - Feature branch from stable
   - Incremental implementation
   - Test after each change

2. **Testing**
   - Run automated test suite
   - Manual LinkedIn testing
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Error rate monitoring

3. **Staging**
   - Run for 1 week personally
   - Document any issues
   - Fix before proceeding

4. **Release**
   - Merge to main
   - Tag version
   - Update stable branch
   - Document in DECISIONS_LOG

## Risk Management

### Before Each Phase
- Create backup branch
- Document rollback procedure
- Identify potential breaking points
- Create specific tests for new features

### During Development
- Test after every change
- Commit frequently
- Keep changes small
- Document decisions

### If Something Breaks
- Immediate rollback to stable
- Document what broke
- Create test to prevent recurrence
- Try alternative approach

## Principles

1. **Stability First** - Never sacrifice stability for features
2. **Incremental Progress** - Small steps are better than big leaps
3. **Test Everything** - Automated and manual testing
4. **Document Decisions** - Future context is invaluable
5. **User Focus** - Features that actually help users

## Timeline Philosophy

No hard deadlines. Each phase proceeds only when:
- Previous phase is stable
- Tests are comprehensive
- Documentation is complete
- Rollback plan exists

Better to have a working v1.0.1 forever than a broken v2.0.0.

**Remember**: Every failed "improvement" started with good intentions. Proceed with caution, test extensively, and always maintain a working fallback.
